# Anthony Neves 
    Data Analyst - Porto, Portugal and New York, USA
## Summary
I'm looking to develop myself into a full-time data analyst building both a career and freelance portflio. I don't have a traditional data analysis background
but always found myself running the analytics for my departments and teams and looking for ways to scrape data and automate tasks.

I have experience in Winemaking, Tourism, Finance and Math. I'm looking to combine these newfound data skills to my past experiences and look for portflio and work opportunities.
In 2024 I will build 5 data driven projects here on this site to show off my passions.
